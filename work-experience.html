                <h3>AWS, Summer 2022</h3>
                <p>I delivered a code coverage feature for developer tools that was later moved into production. The project 
                    largely consisted of understanding the existing code base, using data transformation to extend the current
                     code coverage tools, and testing my work.</p>
                <p>I acted quickly to handle problems before they grew, worked iteratively, learned from team expertise, 
                    supported team efforts, and reinforced the methods taught by Amazon learning programs. I earned a full 
                    time return offer from this team.</p>

                <h3>AWS, Summer 2021</h3>
                <p>The Amazon Propel Program is designed to elevate opportunities for underrepresented groups in tech. 
                    I began my internship with a four week software bootcamp. My performance earned me a Summa Cum Laude 
                    and Magna Cum Laude award from the Seattle chapter. Then I had eight weeks to design and build a 
                    regression analysis tool that compared the performance of Amazon Lex machine learning models. The tool 
                    was later put into production and is still used by the team.</p>

                <h1>HVAC&R Building Controls Intern</h1>
                <h3>ACCO Engineered Systems, Summer 2019</h3>
                <p>As a building controls intern, I documented network structures for automated building equipment on more than
                    30 commercial projects so that HVAC systems could be monitored and managed remotely. I also programmed the logic and user interface 
                    for each type of equipment on 3 major projects using ACCO company standards.</p>
                <p>Alongside my work on controls, I worked on various mechanical systems. I helped to design mechanical room layouts and performed 
                    water tank sizings, load calculations, and valve sizings. I also participated in several jobsite visits, where I encountered 
                    mechanical systems firsthand.</p>
                <p>Programs Used: AutoCAD, Visio, SiteBuilder</p>
