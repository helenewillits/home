            <p>Team Tech is a faction of the Society of Women Engineers that designs and prototypes a product for 
                industry use. In 2018, Team Tech partnered with Boeing to develop a stowable treadmill for 
                passengers with Deep Vein Thrombosis, who are at risk of developing blood clots if they are seated
                 for too long in flight. The device doubled as an emergency seat for flight attendants and was 
                 required to meet industry safety standards.</p>

                            environmental, and health effects of our project. I was responsible for reporting 
                            back to other team leads on the progress of our research. I also conducted research 
                            and compiled a technical report for Boeing.</p>

                        <p>In storage and deployment, I researched, designed, and built components of the 
                            treadmill that allowed it to be stored and deployed safely and easily. I worked 
                            primarily with locking mechanisms, employing car door locks to secure the treadmill 
                            against the wall of the aircraft and support the weight of a flight attendant seat 
                            per emergency protocol.</p>
